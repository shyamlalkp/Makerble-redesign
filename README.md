# Makerble-redesign
Makerble is a powerful platform with a wide variety of features. Many of the features were designed to be functional, which means that the features work well, but the UI of those features could be better. My task is to reimagine what the Home page could look like and redesign it so that all the information that is currently there is accessible.
